#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Development for STM32F103C8T6 Embedded Programming
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use #include "stm32f1xx.h" without errors, you need to install the STM32 HAL/LL driver headers 
on your system and set up your project to find them. Here's how to do that:

1. Download STM32CubeF1 HAL package
```bash
	git clone https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF1.git
```
Or download directly from:
```bash
	wget https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF1
```

2. Locate stm32f1xx.h
STM32CubeF1/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F1xx/Include/stm32f1xx.h
STM32CubeF1/Drivers/STM32F1xx_HAL_Driver/Inc/stm32f1xx_hal_gpio.h

3. Add the include paths to your Makefile
Add these to your CFLAGS:

```
CFLAGS += -I/path/to/STM32CubeF1/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F1xx/Include
CFLAGS += -I/path/to/STM32CubeF1/Drivers/CMSIS/Include
CFLAGS += -I/path/to/STM32CubeF1/Drivers/STM32F1xx_HAL_Driver/Inc
```

4. Compile with the correct ARM toolchain
Use arm-none-eabi-gcc, not regular gcc.

```sh
sudo dnf install arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs arm-none-eabi-newlib
```

5. Then compile with:
```sh
arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -o your_program.elf your_source.c $(CFLAGS)
```

CMSIS
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5.git
cd CMSIS_5
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd CMSIS_5/CMSIS/Device
git submodule add https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_f1.git ST/STM32F1xx
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Foundamental
# GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output)

GPIO is a fundamental feature on microcontrollers. Each GPIO pin can be configured to act as either:
    Input: To read signals (e.g., from a button or sensor).
    Output: To control devices (e.g., turn an LED or buzzer on/off).

Example use cases:
    Read a switch → input.
    Blink an LED → output.

On the STM32F103, you configure GPIO using registers like GPIOx->CRL, GPIOx->ODR, GPIOx->IDR, etc.

# PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

PWM is a technique used to simulate analog output using digital signals by rapidly toggling a pin on/off with a specific duty cycle.
    Duty cycle = the percentage of time the signal is HIGH in each period.
    Commonly used to:
        Control motor speed
        Dim LEDs
        Control servo positions

In STM32, PWM is generated using timers (e.g., TIM2, TIM3), configured to output a square wave with adjustable duty cycle.

Purpose	            Type	Pin       config
-----------------------------------------------
LED	                GPIO   Output	On/Off state
Ultrasonic Trigger	GPIO   Output	Short pulse
Ultrasonic Echo	    GPIO   Input	Detect signal
Motor Speed	        PWM   Output	Vary speed

# HAL 
Stands for Hardware Abstraction Layer. It's a high-level API provided 
by STMicroelectronics (the maker of STM32 chips) to simplify programming their microcontrollers.

- What HAL Does:
	HAL wraps low-level hardware access in easy-to-use C functions. 
	Instead of writing directly to registers like 
	"GPIOA->ODR |= (1 << 5);" write  "HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, GPIO_PIN_SET);"

So HAL:
- Makes code more portable across STM32 families.
- Hides the complexity of register-level programming.
- Provides ready-to-use drivers for peripherals like USART, SPI, I2C, etc.

## HAL vs. CMSIS vs. Direct Register Access

Layer	        Example	                                        Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HAL (High)	    HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13);	        Easy, but adds overhead.
LL (Low Layer)	LL_GPIO_SetOutputPin(GPIOC, LL_GPIO_PIN_13);	Lightweight alternative to HAL.
CMSIS	        `GPIOC->ODR	                                    = (1 << 13);`
Bare Metal	    Register manipulation	                        Fastest, smallest, but hardest to maintain.


## Why You’re Not Using HAL
In Belfhym project, chose to not use HAL for more control, 
lower overhead, and better learning of how STM32 hardware really work and directly use:

#include "stm32f1xx.h"

GPIOA->CRL = ...;
GPIOA->ODR |= (1 << 5);

This is bare-metal programming using CMSIS headers only.

Use Case	                     Recommendation
-----------------------------------------------------
Fast dev, portability	         HAL
Maximum efficiency, control	     Direct + CMSIS
Critical timing or safety	     CMSIS or Bare Metal
Balanced project	             Mix of HAL and Direct

# Deplypment

# Here’s the minimal list of what you need
To deploy and test your Belfhym project on the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) board, 
a Blue Pill alone is not enough — you’ll also need tools to power it, program it, and potentially debug it.

1. STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill Board
   This is your actual microcontroller board.
   !!!Make sure it's a good-quality one (some clones have bad USB connectors or faulty crystals).

2. ST-Link V2 Programmer/Debugger
   You must have this to flash your firmware (unless you want to use the built-in bootloader via UART, which is less convenient).
   ST-Link also allows debugging via SWD, which is critical for FreeRTOS and embedded debugging.
   !!!Beware of super-cheap ST-Link clones — they often work but might have limitations or be unstable.

3. Dupont Cables (Male-to-Female or Male-to-Male)
    You’ll need 4 wires to connect ST-Link to the Blue Pill:
    - SWDIO
	- SWCLK
	- GND
	- 3.3V (optional; ST-Link can power the board if connected)
	
4. USB to Serial Adapter (Optional but Useful)
   For debugging via UART (e.g., printf() debugging).
   Useful for serial console output or bootloader flashing if needed.

5. USB Mini-B Cable
   To power the Blue Pill through its USB port.
   Also needed if you ever want to use USB (e.g., CDC/Serial over USB) in your project.

6. Breadboard and Power Supply (Optional)
   Handy for experimenting, connecting sensors, or prototyping.
   
   
Item	                Required	Notes
---------------------------------------------------------
STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill	    R   Main board
ST-Link V2	                R	Programming and SWD debugging
Dupont wires	            R	For connecting ST-Link
USB to Serial Adapter	    - 	Optional, for UART debugging
USB Mini-B cable	        R	Power and USB features
Breadboard + PSU	        -	Optional for prototyping

---

# Step-by-Step Deployment Process

1. Connect ST-Link V2 to Blue Pill
   - Use jumper wires to connect the ST-Link to the Blue Pill:
   - ST-Link → Blue Pill
	 -------------------
	 SWDIO   → SWIO (PA13)
	 SWCLK   → SWCLK (PA14)
	 GND     → GND
	 3.3V    → 3.3V

2. Power Source: The ST-Link supplies power (3.3V), no need for USB or other power unless required by peripherals.
3. Software Setup on Linux
   1. Install toolchain and flashing tools
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib openocd
   ```
   
   2. Install stlink-tools for direct flashing
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install stlink
   ```
   3. Plug it into USB and verify ST-Link is connected
   ```bash
   lsusb | grep ST-LINK
   ```
4. Build Firmware (hermes)
```bash
make clean
make
```
5. Flash Firmware to Blue Pill
	- Option 1:
	 1. Start OpenOCD server:
	 ```bash
	 openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f1x.cfg
	 ```
	 2. In a separate terminal:
	 ```bash
	 telnet localhost 4444
	 ```
	 3. Then
	 ```bash
	 reset halt
	 flash write_image erase bin/hermes 0x08000000
	 reset run
	 exit
	 ```
	 - Option 2: 
	 1. Flash with st-flash
	 ```bash
	 st-flash write build/hermes.bin 0x8000000
	 ```
    - Option 3:
	```bash
	make deploy
	```

## Debug or Monitor Output
1. If your firmware sends serial data via USART1 (PA9/PA10), use your USB-to-Serial adapter:
    PA9 → TX
    PA10 → RX
	GND → GND
	Then use a tool like minicom:
	```bash
	sudo dnf install minicom
	minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
	```
